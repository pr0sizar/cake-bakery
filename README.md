# Cake Bakery Project

The Cake Bakery Project is a Java-based application designed to manage a bakery system for creating and handling different types of cakes. It provides functionalities to create cakes with various flavors, fillings, and buttercream types.

## Project Description

The project is structured into several classes, each representing a specific aspect of the cake bakery system. Here's a brief overview of the main components:

### Cake Class

The `Cake` class represents a basic cake entity. It contains attributes such as flavor, size, and filling. Each cake object can have a specific type of filling, represented by the `Filling` class, and a type of buttercream, represented by the `ButterCream` class.

### VictoriaCake Class

The `VictoriaCake` class is a subclass of `Cake` specifically designed for Victoria sponge cakes. It extends the functionality of the `Cake` class to include additional attributes such as whether the cake contains berries.

### Filling Class

The `Filling` class represents the filling inside the cake. It contains attributes such as color and amount.

### ButterCream Class

The `ButterCream` class represents the buttercream frosting on the cake. It contains attributes such as type, color, and quantity.

### Main Class (HOMEWORK7)

The `HOMEWORK7` class serves as the entry point for the application. It demonstrates the usage of arrays and ArrayLists to manage collections of cakes. It instantiates cake objects with different characteristics and prints out their details.

## Features

- Create cakes with different flavors, sizes, fillings, and buttercream types.
- Manage collections of cakes using arrays and ArrayLists.
- Demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism with the `Cake` and `VictoriaCake` classes.

## Programming Topics:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Class and object instantiation
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Method invocation and parameter passing

## Language:

- Java

## Getting Started

To run the Cake Bakery Project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the `HOMEWORK7` class to execute the application.
